**Advanced Exploitation Toolkit for Next.js Server Actions (CVE-2025-55182).**

React2Shell is a powerful, interactive shell wrapper designed to exploit the React2Shell vulnerability. It goes beyond simple RCE by providing command history, file transfer capabilities, and automated privilege escalation strategies.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Single-File Executable**: Consolidates exploit logic and shell interface into one script. Zero external dependencies.
- **Interactive Shell**: Full pseudo-terminal experience with command history.
- **Auto-Root Escalation**: Built-in pipe injection strategy (`base64 | sudo -i`) to bypass shell restrictions and escalate to root instantly.
- **File Operations**:
  - `.download <remote> [local]`: Reliable binary-safe file download using base64 encoding.
  - `.save`: Save command output to local evidence files.
- **Base64 Evasion**: Automatically encodes payloads to bypass basic WAF filters and shell quoting issues.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xalgord/React2Shell.git
cd React2Shell
pip install requests
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 react2shell.py -u https://target-nextjs-site.com/
```

### Advanced Usage
Run with verified root persistence strategy detection:
```bash
python3 react2shell.py -u https://target.com/
```

## 🎮 Command Interface

Once inside the shell:

| Command | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `.root` | Toggle **Root Mode** (Wraps commands in `sudo -i`) |
| `.download <file>` | Download a file from the remote server |
| `.save` | Save the last command's output to a file |
| `.exit` | Exit the shell |

### Example Session
```bash
ubuntu@target:~$ id
uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu)...

ubuntu@target:~$ .root
[*] Root mode ENABLED

root@target:~$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
